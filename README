eXtended Library for embedded devices
Copyright (c) 2016 Moreno Seri (moreno.seri@gmail.com)

This is my contribution to embedded devices development world.

The library is composed by various level of functionalities:
- XMain.h: main functionalities needed by the other levels;
- XGraph.h: all the basic abstract graphics funcions;
- XDevice.h: devices specific classes based on XGraph classes;
- XUI: generic user interface management that makes use of XGraph classes.

XUI needs to be completed by the moment and is not included.
